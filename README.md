# flask_e2e_project

## Web service explanation
The web service I created is a Healthcare Appointment Booking System. Originally, I wanted to create this app for the patients, but after many difficulties, this app is good for healthcare providers to look for patients, appointments, labs and prescriptions. 
For this project, I create a web service in Azure, use flask to deploy and python for the coding part.
