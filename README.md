# flask_e2e_project

## Web service explanation
The web service I created is a Healthacre Appointment Booking System. This system allows patients to schedule appointments with healthacare providers, manage their medical history and receive reminders. 
For this project, I create a web service in Azure, use flask to deploy and python for the coding part.
